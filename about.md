I'm a software developer and an entrepreneur currently living in Montreal, Canada.

My current focus is to learn as much as I can about machine learning. I superficially remember studying AI back when I did my computer engineering degree in 2004 and while it was cool back then, there didn't seem to be many real life applications just yet. Well that certainly changed since then :-).

From 2012 to 2017, along with the team at Ululab, I worked on expanding how video games can become efficient tools for conceptual learning. Our first commercial product, Slice Fractions, was released in 2014 and caught the attention of both parents and educators around the world. Today, our biggest markets are the United States, Japan and China.

Prior to cofounding Ululab, I was a software engineer at Microsoft in Seattle, WA and Vancouver B.C. where I had the chance to work on improving the security of Internet Explorer, now Edge, and making cool web technologies more efficient and available to millions of users.

Outside of work, I enjoy being a dad and spending time with my family.
