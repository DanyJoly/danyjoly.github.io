I'm a software developer and an entrepreneur currently living in Montreal, Canada.

My current focus is to learn as much as I can about how to scale up web-deployed solutions, and how machine learning works. 

From 2012 to 2018, along with the team at Ululab, I worked on expanding how video games can become practical tools for conceptual learning. Our first commercial product, Slice Fractions, was released in 2014 and caught the attention of both parents and educators around the world. Today, our most significant markets are the United States, Japan, and China.

Before co-founding Ululab, I was a software engineer at Microsoft in Redmond, WA, and Vancouver B.C. There, I had the chance to work on improving the security of Internet Explorer, now Edge, and making cool web technologies more efficient and available to millions of users.

Outside of work, I enjoy being a dad and spending time with my family.
