title: Finding happiness by shipping a Slice Fractions Sequel

So last post I mentioned that after putting Secret Powers: Animals on hold, we managed to turn things around at Ululab.

Once that hard decision was taken and we had done our post-mortem, we had to ask ourselves what we wanted to do now. What goals do we want to achieve? We didn't feel ready for another large make or break project and we needed to stabilize the company's expenses and revenues, so a string of ~~easy~~ easier successes seemed more appropriate for 2017.

By that point, we felt ready to revisit Slice Fractions. The game is still beloved by children, their parents and their teachers. Sales are doing OK and there is now a core of academic research showing that it has a [positive impact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JAklIVvk7E) on children understanding of concepts related to fractions. What's not to like?

Fran√ßois' got plenty of good ideas for a sequel and because the original Slice Fractions is already ported to the Unity 3D game engine, making a sequel is proving to be a walk in the park from a technological perspective. The original Slice Fractions was first coded in ActionScript / Adobe Air to support older PC in schools. Let's just say life is a tad bit easier with Unity :-).

So far, I think the game looks awesome and will be a huge improvement over the original one. I'm very excited to see it on mobile stores!

As the game progress for a very early 2018 release, we'll put out more details through Ululab's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Ululab/) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ululab).
