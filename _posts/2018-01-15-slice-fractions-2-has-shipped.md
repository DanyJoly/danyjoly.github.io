I'm very proud to announce that [Slice Fractions 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slice-fractions-2/id1313342412?mt=8) has finally shipped on the Apple App Store and that the reviews are great!

Fran√ßois did an awesome job with the new learning mechanics like the snails bridges and the ghosts (multiplication). We were in luck to have been able to work with people as talented and competent as [Annie Rodrigue](moonlight-whispers.com) and [Brian Britigan](https://www.brianbritigan.com/) for the visuals and [Vibe Avenue](http://vibeavenue.com/) for the music and audio.

2017 was a great year for Ululab and it feels good to ship something that will make a difference for students out there. I can't wait to see the research results to know what's the measured impact on fractions comprehension.

*2018-02-15 Update*: Slice Fractions 2 is a [BolognaRagazzi Digital Award winner](http://www.bolognachildrensbookfair.com/en/bologna-childrens-book-fair-awards/bolognaragazzi-digital-award/2018-winners/2018-overall-winners/7172.html) at the 2018 Bologna Children's Book Fair! :-D
